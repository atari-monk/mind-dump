# 🧘‍♂️ Atari Monk — Mind Dump

Welcome to the **Mind Dump** — the unfiltered dojo for raw thoughts.  
Nothing here is polished. Nothing is final. Just brain to page.

---

## ✨ Purpose

- Capture thoughts, ideas, rants, dreams, questions—anything.  
- Remove friction between brain → text → future insight.  
- Don’t lose sparks waiting for perfection.

---

## 📜 How to Use

- Use nested folders by theme — e.g., `dreams/`, `rants/`, `ideas/`  
- Drop `.md` files as needed inside each category.  
- Write freely. No editing, no filter.  
- Chaos is allowed.  
- Review occasionally to promote gold to `dev-blog` or prune to trash.

## 🔓 Rules

1. **Unhinged:** Say the weird stuff. The real stuff.  
2. **Unfiltered:** Don’t judge—just dump.  
3. **Harvest:** When you strike gold, extract and polish elsewhere.  
4. **Sacred:** This is your brain’s raw log. Respect the mess.

## 🧘 Monk’s Note

> *“Better an ugly thought captured than a perfect idea forgotten.”*
