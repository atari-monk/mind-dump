**NOTE: On Existence, Simplicity, and Tension**

Existence is strange — inexplicable — yet here it is. The fact that anything *is* at all is the most profound mystery. And in the face of that, striving feels optional.

Each hair is decided.
Every action predetermined or unfolding inevitably.
Why fight? Why reproduce, conquer, dominate?
Perhaps true intelligence lies in realizing: you don’t *have* to do anything.

We construct parts of ourselves, and just as naturally, we deconstruct.
We are always both becoming and unraveling —
sculptor and sculpture, builder and ruins.

In a world full of people greater and lesser,
there is no need to compare.
I don’t care.
I want no pain.
Just food, clothes, and shelter.
Not much more.

There is always tension.
A quiet hum beneath the surface.
I ignore it where I can.
It’s not gone — just carried.
Manageable.

This is not apathy. It is clarity.
It is endurance.
It is a way of being.
