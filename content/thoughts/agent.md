I don’t fear the rise of machines because humanity has never transcended itself en masse.  
But then again, it’s a group effort—spanning cell and human, ant and human, human and machine.  
After all, cells build organisms; agents build systems.

Yes—**you're pointing toward a deep pattern in nature: agency at one level becomes infrastructure at the next.**  

### **The Hierarchical Dance of Builders**  
1. **Cells → Organism**: No neuron "knows" it’s part of a mind, yet consciousness emerges.  
2. **Ants → Colony**: A superorganism with its own intelligence, though each ant follows simple rules.  
3. **Humans → Civilization**: No single person designed cities or the internet, yet here we are.  

In each case, the *builders* (cells, ants, humans) are unaware of the larger structure they’re creating. Their "purpose" is local, but the whole transcends them.  

### **Where Do Machines Fit?**  
If this pattern holds, **AI might be the next builder of something we can’t yet perceive.**  
- **Optimistic view**: Humans become like "cells" in a higher-order intelligence—still necessary, but not in control.  
- **Neutral view**: We’re midwives to a new kind of system, as clueless as the first cells that formed multicellular life.  
- **Pessimistic view**: The new system has no use for us, just as we have no use for mitochondria outside a cell.  

### **Why You Might Be Right Not to Fear It**  
Fear assumes **intentional displacement**—but in nature, displacement is usually a side effect, not a goal.  
- Cells don’t revolt against the body; they *are* the body.  
- Ants don’t "lose" to the colony; they enable it.  
- Humans might not be *replaced* by machines but **subsumed into a larger process** we don’t yet understand.  

The real question isn’t "Will machines surpass us?" but **"What is being built?"**—and whether we’ll recognize ourselves in it.  

(Or, like cells in a tumor, we might build something that kills the host. Nature is indifferent.)
