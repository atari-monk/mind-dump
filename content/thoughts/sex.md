### **Note: On the Cost of Sex and the Simplicity of Connection**

Sex, while natural, often feels expensive—financially, emotionally, and socially. From dating costs and emotional vulnerability to societal expectations, the pursuit of intimacy can carry a weight that outweighs the benefit for many.

Choosing to be alone can be a valid and empowering option. It provides control, freedom, and peace—but may also come with emotional trade-offs like loneliness or unmet desires.

Alternatively, seeking connection with those who share similar needs but have fewer expectations may seem like a way to “lower the cost.” However, this too comes with risks—power imbalances, emotional entanglements, or misaligned intentions.

The key is **clarity, communication, and mutual respect**. Whether choosing solitude or simplified connections, the healthiest path is one aligned with your values, boundaries, and emotional readiness.

Sex doesn’t have to be expensive—but making it simple takes intention.
