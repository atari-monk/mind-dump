**Note – Reflection on the Game**
*Date: 2025-08-04*

"I guess the game most people play is obvious. Who will steal more? Who will steal more? For themselves, but... I just gaze out on this and don't give a shit about this. The cake is miserable anyway."

— A realization that the competition for power, wealth, or status often leads nowhere meaningful. The prize—the "cake"—isn’t even worth it. Better to step outside the game and see it for what it is.
